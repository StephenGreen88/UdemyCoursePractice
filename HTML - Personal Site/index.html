  <h1>Stephen L Green</h1>
  <p><em>Marketing Enthusiast and Full-Stack Web Developer</em></p>
  <p>I am a Front-End Web Developer/Marketing Enthusiast with a background in Sales, Marketing
    and Risk Operations. <br>I am passionate about creating aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly websites that
    provide shared value to users and companies. <br>I accomplish this by keeping end user in mind and focusing on a
    pleasant and pain-free experience while surfing the
    web.</p>
  <p>To supplement my passion for user-friendly web-based marketing and products I earned a certificate in Full Stack
    Development from the
    <br> University of Utah's Full-Stack Development coding boot camp.This experience enhanced my existing skill set by
    furthering my knowledge in <br> HTML, JavaScript, MERN stack, CSS, SQL server and responsive web design.</p>
  <p>In my current role, I am known for my inquisitive mind, willingness to dive head-on into difficult projects and the
    ability to learn quickly.
    <br> All of these traits combined with my new skills make me an ideal candidate for web development positions.</p>
